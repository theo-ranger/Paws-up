## Getting Started
Requirements: *Xcode 14.0 or above.* The firebase package dependencies should appear after cloning from this repository. However, without authorization to our firebase database, any online features should be unavailable.

## Architecture
* Paws Up is implemented using the *Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)* architecture.
* Model handles any necessary logic and data.
* View displays the frontend to the user
* ViewModel is the intermediate agent responsible for passing information between Model and View. We also have a “repository” module in ViewModel to handle communications with the database.

## Development Frameworks/Platforms
* The front-end is designed with *Figma* and written under the *SwiftUI* framework.
* The database we are using is Google’s *Firebase*.

## Features
### Homepage
An instagram-like page where the users can create posts to share their love of animals. Users can also make special posts if they find a lost pet or have lost a pet themselves.

### Maps
Integrates Apple Maps which can be used to provide locations of lost pets. If users find a lost pet, they can mark it on the map. Users can also mark their own pet if they have lost a pet.

### Profile
This page also works like instagram which displays basic information and users’ published posts.
